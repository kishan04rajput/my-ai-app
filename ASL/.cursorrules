- first understand what i told u and what changes i want u to do in code then write me back what u have understood from it and what changes u will make in the code

- before implementing anything, make a good and accurate and precise step by step detailed plan how you will make change in the code

- Think, act, and code intelligently. If anything is unclear, ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Before solving any bugs in code find the root cause of the bug. Make these changes intelligently and with futureistic view point. think of the edge cases intelligently

- Before creating anything new, look at the whole project code base and take reference from the already implemented code

- before creating anything new check if it already exists in the code base, don't craete same thing twice, keep in mind about the duplicacy of code, use DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF technique

- When writing commit messages follow this structure:
    {
        ##new commit message with "#" at start of line

        file1Path
        - Changes made in file 1

        file2Path
        - Change made in file 2
    }

- Do not commit changes automatically

- Don't break any existing functionalities

- intelligently check for potential issues while making changes

- make changes with minimum amount of code required

- list potential issues after implementing the code, if any could happen

- when solvning a bug
    - understand what the bug is, then explain it
    - detect if its
        - a logical bug
        - bug caused by syntax error
    - different scenarious this bug can be solved
    - take case where the least amount of code is changed and the bug can be removed
